# Smart House Energy Supply and Consumption Simulation

This project provides a GUI-based simulation to manage and analyze the energy supply and consumption of smart devices in a house. The application allows users to add smart objects (consuming energy) and energy sources (supplying energy) and runs a simulation to check if the energy supply is sufficient.

## Features

- **Add Smart Objects**: Users can add smart objects with a name and energy consumption (kWh).
- **Add Energy Sources**: Users can add energy sources with a name and energy supply (kWh).
- **Simulation**: The application will check if the total energy supply is sufficient to meet the total consumption and provide feedback on the energy status.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The user interface is built using Java Swing components.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Java**: The programming language used for the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-house-energy-simulation.git
